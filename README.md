# All improvements come from human flaws

## How we think

* The human brain is serial and cannot effectively think about multiple clues in parallel
  * The human brain is not designed to think about multi-threading in parallel execution
    * [Single thread] Change the programming mode of shared variables to the mode of overall transaction submission
  * The human brain is not designed to think about multiple independent business processes presented on the screen at the same time
    * The code is organized according to the time of occurrence, and the codes together may not be logically related business processes.
      * [Split files by business] Readers should be able to track the index according to their own task goals, instead of defaulting that the processing logic caused by a button click must be written in a large file
      * [Split files according to frequency of change] Business changes are the primary reason for reading, and the code should be organized according to the frequency of business changes. Code that changes at the same time should be kept together
  * It is difficult for the human brain to manage multiple independent and variable states. Essentially, each independently changing state is an independent thread.
    * Three major factors that drive the entropy increase in the number of states:
      * Due to the requirements of interactive experience, from the backend to the rich client to 3D animation, the state is copied multiple times, getting closer and closer to the display layer
      * Due to hardware physical constraints, memory has changed from unified addressing by CPU to heterogeneous computing and CUDA. Each hardware core has its own layer of memory.
      * Due to the growth in data volume, from the unified OLAP slave database to Data Lake and Data Mart, data is copied into more and more copies, and the pipeline is getting longer and longer.
    *Means to combat the entropy increase in the number of states:
      * [Declarative data linkage] Reduce independently changing states and use expressions to express derived state
      * [Global virtual data layer] Draw on the unified file abstraction of Unix and introduce a unified virtual data layer. Convert status into cache as much as possible
  * It is difficult for the human brain to understand the drastic changes in the original behavior caused by new additions, and is more accustomed to stable stacking layer by layer. In other words, people prefer to “control variables”
    * The biggest difficulty of CSS is that it is not orthogonal. Adding a pair of rules will cause unexpected effects.
      * [Localized layout] Swiftui's HStack/VStack/ZStack layout rules have a small number of rules, and each rule functions as a local and stable superposition.
    * Performance optimization often requires the destruction of locality, because local autonomy can easily lead to duplication of work
      * [Localized IO] The system automatically realizes I/O batching and other global optimization that can be automated
      * [Localized IO] The business is written to be autonomous, but additional manual global tuning can be added. Instead of forcing the business logic to be extracted from the local area

## How we perceive

* The human eye can only obtain information in a narrow receptive field
  * Human perception of time comes from the perception of space
  * People want to get information from morning to night in chronological order from top to bottom on a screen
    * The programming method of callback destroys the direct mapping relationship between the order on the screen and the time order.
      * [Coroutine IO] Replace callback with coroutine to straighten the code on the screen
    * The business state machine driven by the status field destroys the direct mapping relationship between the order on the screen and the time order.
      * [Coroutine Business Process] Use coroutines to replace the status state machine and straighten the code on the screen.
  * Due to limitations of the receptive field, the source code does not have space to show all the details.
    * "Details" such as type definitions and memory allocation occupy a large amount of visual area
      * [IDE details hidden] Omit details in the text, complete them by the IDE, and display them when the mouse moves up.
    * The most accustomed way of organizing space is still layered folders
      * All "architecture" design is ultimately the design of folders and files. However, a static index of one dimension (nested folders) cannot satisfy all possible retrieval needs.
        * [IDE on-demand indexing] The IDE completes the indexing needs that cannot be met by folder classification, and designs the IDE index based on the reader's tasks.
  * Rod cells tend to ignore differences in shape and order, but are more sensitive to color
    * Syntax highlighting takes up valuable resources, but does not consider the readers' demands.
      * [IDE on-demand highlighting] For different tasks, readers hope to find different points, and syntax highlighting should be done in conjunction with the tasks.

## How we collaborate

* The most efficient way of communication between people is face-to-face interactive sound wave vibration
  * Humans’ low communication bandwidth fundamentally limits the size of a team
    * The faster the online speed is required, the better, but the marginal benefits brought by adding people are diminishing
      * Reduce meetings to coordinate, and the team should be as autonomous as possible instead of relying on the feature team to coordinate everything horizontally
        * High cohesion, low coupling
          * [Static link package] Programming tools should provide more combination possibilities, not all combinations must be implemented using object-oriented polymorphism at runtime
          * [Separate subcontracting according to change frequency] The division of labor should be determined according to the frequency of change, and the division of labor should be clear
  * As much as possible, the problem should be solved by the end user, or a team close to the end user, rather than transmitting requirements over long distances
    * End-user programming: directly let the requester implement the request himself
      * To build "learning" into a tool, a teaching tool needs to be built in
        * End-user programming tools are difficult and costly to develop, and the investment exceeds the return on individual software
          * [Editor Prefabrication] Prefab common needs such as "formula editing" and "store decoration" in advance
      * The goal of teaching tools is teaching, not benchmarking yourself for more advanced productivity
        * [Built-in teaching] Provides seamless switching between teaching mode and productivity mode
    * Low-code programming: By prefabricating in advance, the workload is forwarded, reducing the scale of application developers, so that developers can be built into the user organization in terms of organizational structure. Corresponding to this is document-driven outsourced development.
      * "Prefabrication" comes from the advance judgment of common needs
        * [Non-functional requirements cloudification] The implementation of non-functional requirements are all run on similar machines
          * operating system
          * k8s
          * RPC framework
        * Developers are human
          * Programming Tools
          * Communication tools
        * Users are all humans
          *【SaaS Component】IM/Phone/SMS
          * [Ui Component] Word Processor/Table
          * [CRUD generation] Idiomatic presentation and interaction
            * Listing details
            *Tree level
            * Table structure
            * Drag-and-drop whiteboard
        * [SaaS component] Relatively stable business process
          * log in Register
          * Pay
        * Relatively stable common business processes in the industry
          * E-commerce
          *HR/Recruitment
          * Sales Management/CRM

## How we learn

* Human’s ability to “summarize/understand/learn” is highly dependent on visual and interactive manipulation and feedback
  * Help should be placed where the task is performed, rather than "visible", it should be said to be "discoverable"
    * [Change fill-in-the-blank questions into multiple-choice questions] A separate grammar manual is not easy to use. You must provide buttons on the interface to turn fill-in-the-blank questions into multiple-choice questions, so as to inspire learning.
      * GUI designer/shop decoration
      * Formula editor
      * Approval/workflow designer
      * trigger process designer
  * People are accustomed to touching objects with their hands and then observing their feedback, thereby inductively learning
    * Unobservable behavior cannot be learned
      * Bugs in the production environment cannot be reproduced locally. How can I find the pattern?
        * 【TestInProduction】tracing, a large amount of tracing, traffic playback
      * There is no clue about the bug in the lowcode platform. What can I do except contact the platform developer?
        * Users cannot be required to understand all internal details, and the "platform" must be reliable
        * The location of business logic problems is the same as the location of bugs in the production environment, relying on tracing
    * The negative feelings given by behavior that is too slow to respond will increase exponentially
      * The local machine is too slow to run. You need to use the company's sandbox environment to reproduce the problem.
        *【Cloud IDE】
      * After changing the code, you need to recompile and reload it.
        * 【LanguageServer】Skip unnecessary compilation during interactive development
        * [What you see is what you get] What you see is what you get GUI development is essentially to use an interpreter to execute in exchange for reducing compilation time
        * [HMR] Maintain page status when reloading

# no code / low code / pro code

All improvements come from human flaws

* no code: Program it for your own use, giving users the feeling of a more powerful office/utility software. The main method is to use graphical operations and other methods to reduce the learning curve. No code must be oriented to a very fixed field to be useful.
* low code: programming for other people to use, creating a concept of citizen developer for this purpose. The main method is to pre-prepare common requirements on the platform to reduce the need to write code from scratch. Low code also needs to be oriented to specified fields so that the platform can predict needs in advance, but compared to no code, the usage scenarios are not so strictly limited.
* pro code: The low code platform itself will not choose low code to create the platform itself, because low code does not reduce the cost of building a system from scratch. But the pro code platform itself will choose pro code to create the platform itself. For example, react developers will choose to use react to create their own development tools, because pro code's tools and platforms are designed to fundamentally reduce the cost of building a system from scratch. Complexity is the goal.
